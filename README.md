## Scripts
There are two scripts included in the repo.
- ribConverter will convert a mesh from maya into a subdivision mesh for Renderman.
- turntable will use the main scene file to render a 360 degree image sequence and video of the scene (it's a bit hacky so you should run the script from the root project directory).
